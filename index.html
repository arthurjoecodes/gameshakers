They later partner with rapper Double G, who becomes their investor as part of a compromise for their illegal use of his song, "Drop Dat What", in their game. Double G's son, Triple G, then becomes a video game consultant for the company, making him the fourth Game Shaker.

When Dr. Minyak plans to ruin Double G's worldwide charity concert, Captain Man and Kid Danger join forces with the Game Shakers to defeat Dr. Minyak and keep Double G safe.
There is a Henry Danger and Game Shakers Crossover that has already aired, though it does not count as a Game Shakers episode. The season was originally ordered for 20 episodes, but it got shortened to 18 episodes.
If you didn't already know, this episode is a crossover episode between Henry Danger and The Thundermans. Personally, this crossover was just average. This was just one of the more forgettable episodes, even though it's a crossover. At least these two worlds are very similar so that helps.
“Since several Schneider's Bakery projects are wrapping up, both sides agreed that this is a natural time for Nickelodeon and Schneider's Bakery to pursue other opportunities and projects. ... The decision comes as Nickelodeon has opted to cancel Schneider's latest series, Game Shakers after three seasons.
